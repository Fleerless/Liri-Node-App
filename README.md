# Liri-Node-App

Welcome to LIRI!

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. liri.js utilizes Inquirer to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. There is one more bonus function, entitled "do-what-it-says", which will ask you to specify either "songs", "concerts", or "movies", then will search the relevant API for a predetermined query term. If you can't remember what to type in to the "do-what-it-says" function, just look up at the inquirer prompt options, the spelling will be the same. The result of the search will display the resulting movie, song, or list of upcoming concerts, AND print them to the file log.txt.
